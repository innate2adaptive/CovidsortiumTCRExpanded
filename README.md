# CovidsortiumTCRExpanded
Scripts that produce data and figures for the COVIDsortium TCR paper (Aug 2022)

### Figures â€“ data and scripts

Current version of MS is Word file TCR_COV2_V5.docx; Current main figures : Figures_V4.pptx; Current supplementary figures : Figures_S_V2.pptx 

Data can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/neg3lpofw85l9ng/AAAw-HckR7LYxKz7TMNQ90zca?dl=0

Scripts in: scripts/

Output plots in: output_figs/

#### Main figs
- [x] **1A** script_1.R, this makes the dot plots for each patient, between parwise timepoints. 

Need to run twice, once for alpha, and once for beta. Produces plots; and a list of up and downregulated TCRs, which is saved as "TCR_change_all_alpha.RData" and "TCR_change_all_beta.RData"

*I am missing a script here that goes from TCR_change_all_[alpha/beta].RData to exp_AB_wide1.RData (?)*

On exp_AB_wide1.RData, you run Fig_1_remove_invariant.R to remove MAIT and IkT cells from the expanded list -> obtain exp_AB_wide3.RData

*I didn't have exp_AB_wide1.RData from Benny, so I used the version I had in my old repo*

*The new axes here are shifted by a power of 2. When I plot with Benny's plotting without renaming axes, I get the same axes as on my new plots. Was there a reason Benny had shifted the axes by a power of 2?*

- [x] **1B** bulk_analysis_expanded.R calculates richness, Shannon diversity, Renyi etc from exp_AB_wide3.R, then saves it to a result file. Then plot with Fig1b.R

- [x] **1C, D** script_2.R, Section B

- [x] **1E, F** script_3.R - plots dynamics for each patient separately.

- [x] **2A, B, C** Numbers and stacked histogram in matches_summary.xlsx 

*I don't fully understand matches_summary.xlsx, so I left them as they were, just changed the font and the styling*

- [x] **2D** script_4.R Section C. 

*script_4.R uses exp_AB_merge2.txt, which I don't know where it is generated?*
*script_4.R also uses summary_with_HLA.txt, which I did not have, so got from my other repo*

- [x] **2E** script_4.R, Section A. Save heatmap and legend separately.

- [ ] **2F** Scripts from Martina to add.

- [ ] **Fig 3**

- [ ] **Fig 4** Scripts from Cedric to add.

- [ ] **Fig 5** Scripts? Data?

#### Additional scripts

Fig_1_remove_invariant.R removes MAIT and IkT cells from the expanded list.

#### Supplementary

- [ ] **S1** FACS Plots from Michal - *they are a little pixelated, is there another version?*

- [x] **S2** script_2.R, Section A - 2 separate heatmaps for PCR+ and PCR-

- [ ] **S3** script_S1.R

- [x] **S4** bulk_analysis_all.R, this takes all_A_long.Rdata and all_B_long.Rdata as input, and calculates some of the standard bulk metrics. The script then saves the results. This is equivalent to bulk_analysis_expanded.R. Then plot with FigS4.R.

- [x] **S5** script_1.R

- [x] **S6** script_2.R Section D. Script 2 also produces a summary file - summary_data.csv with patient information and some key metrics

- [ ] **S7** ???

- [x] **S8A, B** script_3.R

- [ ] **S9** Plots from Yanchun Peng

- [ ] **S10** ???

- [x] **S11** script_4.R Section B

- [ ] **S12** Script from Martina to add

- [ ] **S13** Script from Martina to add

- [x] **S14** Generated by TP, Pymol?

### Notes:

**script_4.R**: missing summary_with_HLA.txt, so does not run fully
